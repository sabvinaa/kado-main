        <span>Assalamualaikum Ya Habibi. First of all, thank you for all that you have done for me.
            Though we have only known each other for a relatively short period of time, you have showed me
            what it means to be loved, and I truly hope I have done the same for you. </span>

        <span>There are so many things I wish for you; the biggest being that one day you will see yourself the way I see you.
You have been so very kind to me, your friends and family, my family, and Insyaallah you will learn to be kinder to yourself too.
Truly you are a unique character with a very interesting mindset. I admire your passion, your values and morals, your desire
 to be the best version of yourself and of course, the things you stand for. I have always appreciated all your efforts - the 
 calls, the texts, meeting me, sending me home, sharing knowledge, making me feel protected and more. Being with you have also
  allowed me to discover myself safely, especially as I enter adulthood. 
        </span>
            
        <span>I really am excited to see where this journey will bring us. I have always prayed for your happiness, with
            or without me, and Insyaallah will continue to do so for as long as I can. And I hope you will heal from the things that have 
            scarred you, regardless whether you have told me about them or not. Semoga dimurahkan rezeki dan dipanjangkan umur.
             "Receiving/giving gifts number 5", but here's a little something I hope you can accept and genuinely like :3. 
            Once again, عيد ميلاد سعيد  ♡ Okay I hope I used this correctly. I know patut right to left tapi para dah left to right, sorry HAHA.</span>
